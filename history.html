        <h1>History</h1>

        <p>The history of currencies is a complex and fascinating journey that spans thousands of years. Here is a brief
            overview of the evolution of currencies:</p>

        <h2>Barter System (Pre-600 BCE):</h2>
        <p>In ancient times, people engaged in the barter system, exchanging goods and services directly. However, this
            system had limitations, as it relied on the double coincidence of wants, meaning both parties had to want
            what the other had.</p>

        <h2>Commodity Money (600 BCE - 1000 CE):</h2>
        <p>As societies grew, the barter system became impractical. Commodity money emerged, where certain goods with
            intrinsic value, such as precious metals like gold and silver, were used as a medium of exchange. These
            commodities had value in themselves and were widely accepted.</p>

        <h2>Metal Coins (7th Century BCE):</h2>
        <p>As societies grew, the barter system became impractical. Commodity money emerged, where certain goods with
            intrinsic value, such as precious metals like gold and silver, were used as a medium of exchange. These
            commodities had value in themselves and were widely accepted.</p>

        <h2>Chinese Paper Money (7th Century):</h2>
        <p>China is credited with the invention of paper money during the Tang Dynasty. The Chinese government issued
            the
            first official paper currency, known as "jiaochao."</p>

        <h2>Banknotes in Europe (17th Century):</h2>
        <p>The first European banks issued paper money as promissory notes representing deposits held by the banks. The
            Bank
            of England, founded in 1694, played a crucial role in the development of modern banking and the issuance of
            banknotes.</p>

        <h2>Gold Standard (19th Century - Early 20th Century):</h2>
        <p>Many countries adopted the gold standard, where the value of a country's currency was directly tied to a
            specific
            quantity of gold. This system provided stability but had limitations, especially during economic downturns.
        </p>

        <h2>Bretton Woods Agreement (1944):</h2>
        <p>After World War II, the Bretton Woods Agreement established a system of fixed exchange rates linked to the
            U.S. dollar, which was convertible to gold. This system collapsed in 1971, leading to the end of the gold
            standard.</p>

        <h2>Floating Exchange Rates (1970s - Present):</h2>
        <p>Most countries transitioned to floating exchange rates, where currency values are determined by market
            forces. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) plays a role in managing global currency stability.</p>

        <h2>Digital Currencies (21st Century):</h2>
        <p>The rise of the internet and technological advancements led to the development of digital currencies.
            Bitcoin, created in 2009, is a notable example, using blockchain technology to enable decentralized and
            secure transactions.</p>
